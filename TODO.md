* Exception handling
  * Isn't very good at the moment
  * Handle SIGTERM (clean up before dying). Exceptions and Ctrl-C already

    without running it, so those builds still leak a security group and keypair

* Post-process images
  * Convert image from raw to qcow2 after download 
  `qemu-img convert -O qcow2 img.raw img.qcow2`

  * Upload after post-processing (for end-users)?
